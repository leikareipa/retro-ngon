 * A 3d model exported from Blender using the retro n-gon renderer's exporter.

 * Usage:
 *    - call .initialize(), which populates the .ngons array
 *    - now you can access the n-gons via .ngons
 *    - if you need .initialize() to finish before you start rendering, call it with await inside an async()=>{} wrapper
