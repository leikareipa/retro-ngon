## Unit tests for the retro n-gon renderer

#### How to use
Open the corresponding HTML file in a browser. You'll find a description of what each file does, below.

The tests assume to be located two directories above the renderer's root; e.g. in `rngon/tests/unit/*`.

#### The tests
**[unit-tests.html](unit-tests.html)** &mdash; Conducts all unit tests. When you open the page, you'll get a list of the units tested. If a unit passes its tests, it'll be displayed on the list with a green background. If the unit fails, it'll be displayed with a red background, and further error diagnostics will be printed into the console.
